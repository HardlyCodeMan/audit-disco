### ReEntrance [Contracts](./10-ReEntrancy/)

By utilising a low level call to the donate function sending the malicious contract address and value of ether, we are able to get the malicious contract onto the balances list.

### Remix
Use remix to deploy [HackReEntrance.sol](./10-ReEntrancy/HackReEntrance.sol) **ensure** instance address is used.

### donateToSelf()
```solidity
original.donate.value(amount).gas(1000000000000000)(address(this));
```

### withdraw()
From here it's a simple reentrance attack to have the funds siphoned to a fallback function (in this case receive()) checking the dapp balance as it goes.

### withdrawFunds() 
Drain funds from the attacker contract.

Now you have the funds from the dapp, click the "Submit Instance" button and approve that transaction to complete the level.

✌(◕‿-)✌ Well done, You have completed this level!!!
