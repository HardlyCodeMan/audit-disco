### ReEntrance [Contracts](./10-ReEntrancy/)

By utilising a low level call to the donate function sending the malicious contract address and value of ether, we are able to get the malicious contract onto the balances list.

### donateToSelf()
```solidity
original.donate.value(amount).gas(4000000)(address(this));
```

### withdraw()
From here it's a simple reentrance attack to have the funds siphoned to a fallback function (in this case receive()) checking the dapp balance as it goes.


Now you have the funds from the dapp, click the "Submit Instance" button and approve that transaction to complete the level.

✌(◕‿-)✌ Well done, You have completed this level!!!
