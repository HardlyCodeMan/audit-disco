## Ethernaut 
### Hello Ethernaut

After following the instructions to deploy the level contract on the Rinkeby network (step 7) we start getting into the challenge.

In essence we need to run console commands and read the promise return abi for the next command, see the list of console interactions below.

- contract.info()
- contract.info1()
- contract.info2("Hello")
- contract.infoNum()
- contract.info42()
- contract.theMethodName()
- contract.method7123949()
- contract.password()
- contract.authenticate("ethernaut0")

At this point MetaMask will ask to approve a transaction, do so.

Once that transaction has been completed, click the "Submit Instance" button and approve that transaction to complete the level.

✌(◕‿-)✌ Well done, You have completed this level!!!
