## Ethernaut - 0 - Hello Ethernaut

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial. Have a look at the Solidity code for the contract you just interacted with below.

You are now ready to complete all the levels of the game, and as of now, you're on your own.

Godspeed!!

### Solution

After following the instructions to deploy the level contract on the Rinkeby network (step 7) we start getting into the challenge.

In essence we need to run console commands and read the promise return abi for the next command, see the list of console interactions below.

- contract.info()
- contract.info1()
- contract.info2("Hello")
- contract.infoNum()
- contract.info42()
- contract.theMethodName()
- contract.method7123949()
- contract.password()
- contract.authenticate("ethernaut0")

At this point MetaMask will ask to approve a transaction, do so.

Once that transaction has been completed, click the "Submit Instance" button and approve that transaction to complete the level.

✌(◕‿-)✌ Well done, You have completed this level!!!
